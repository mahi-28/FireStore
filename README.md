# FireStore is a android based application.
It is developed using java and firebase for backend purpose.
This is simple application which does some basic firebasedatabase operation.
In this application I have used one of features provided by firebase is Authentication for register purpose.
I have used email and password authentication method.
And at last I have done insertion into firebase realtime database using UI.
